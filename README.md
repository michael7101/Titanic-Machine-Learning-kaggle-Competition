#### About:
My purpose for entering this challenge is to learn and practice my data analysis skills. In this competition, we use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. The full details of the competition are at https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic.

#### Skill Learnt:
- Python basics
- Data cleaning
- Explore data
- Analysis data 
- Feature engineering

#### The Challenge:
On April 15, 1912, the widely considered "unsinkable" RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage. Unfortunately, there weren't enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, I need to build a predictive model that answers the question: "what sorts of people were more likely to survive?" using our given data set. 

#### Data Used:
I have access to two similar datasets in this competition, including passenger information listed below under the "Variable Descriptions." One dataset is titled train.csv, and the other is titled test.csv.

Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact), and we will reveal whether they survived or not.

The test.csv dataset contains similar information but does not disclose whether each passenger survived. It's my job to predict these outcomes.

Using the patterns I find in the train.csv data, I must predict whether the other 418 passengers onboard (found in test.csv) survived.

#### Variable Descriptions:
- Passenger: unique id number to each passenger
- Survived: passenger survive(1) or died(0)
- P-class: passenger class
- Name: name
- Sex: gender of the passenger
- Age: age of passenger
- SibSp: number of siblings/spouses
- Parch: number of parents/children
- Ticket: ticket number
- Fare: the amount of money spent on the ticket
- Cabin: cabin category
- Embarked: port where passenger embarked (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
